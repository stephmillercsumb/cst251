    <h1>Lab 21: 2nd Draft Team Project Sketches</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>In this lab, we were asked to choose our 3 best designs and scale them
        into larger, more complex drawings. We were also asked to document the
        feedback from our team on our previous designs. My team enjoyed the
        color palette I choose and that I added color to my sketches. Eva-Lyn
        said she liked the idea of more graphic but wasn't sure about how the
        page woould function being more graphic/image-heavy. They collectively
        liked the hand illustration, as well as the large yo-yo in the center
        the corner yo-yo.</p>
    <h2>Difficulties</h2>
        <p>I experienced no difficulties in this lab. </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Pictured below are the three concepts I chose to scale into larger
        drawings. </p>
