	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I didn't have much of a challenge with the file structure, though it did
		look different on a PC. I did however run into a tiny snag with linking the
		image. The code was correct, but the image wouldn't display on my homepage.
		Turns out, I was using the .jpg file format but needed to use .png instead.
		After I changed the file type, it displayed properly. I didn't run into any
		difficulties creating the lab list. The only other challenge I ran into
  	was linking my screenshot to this page (below). I couldn't find any errors
	  in my code and the file shows in my repo, but it still won't display on my
	  browser. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This is the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure that I
		made:</p>
		<img src="lab3/img/file_structures.png" width=650 /><br>
		<p>File Stuctures</p><br>
		<img src="lab3/img/filestructure.png" width=650 /><br>
		<p>File Structure in Atom</p>
		<img src="lab3/img/homepage.jpg" width=650 /><br>
		<p>My homepage in the browser</p><br>
		<img src="lab3/img/homepageindex.jpg"	width=650 /><br>
