    <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>In this lab, we were asked to create another lab folder with an
          index.html file with organzized, sections, divs, and tags. We were
          then asked to style it using class, element and image specifics.
        </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I'm still a little confused about formatting CSS; specifically,
          where to put classes and ID's and what the difference is between the
          two.
        </p>
    <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>The results are this dope ass Lab page. </p>
