<h1>About Me</h1>

<body>

	<main>
		<p>My name is Stephanie. I'm 32 and I love surfing, photography and spending
			time with my family. My partner, Jess, and I own and operate our own sand
			footwear company, ShocSox, in which we design and manufacture protective
			footwear for beach athletes and enthusiasts. We spend most of our spare
			time at the beach or outdoors doing other various activites in nature such
			as hiking, mountainbiking, skateboarding, rollerblading or just going
			for a walk. We have two kids, four rats and a dog, but I hope to add
			another dog to our family soon. A random fact about me is that I am 6 feet
			tall. In the future, I hope to graduate from CSUMB and open my own design
			firm in Maui. </p>
