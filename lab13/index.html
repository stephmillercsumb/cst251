    <h1>Lab 13: Typography I</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>In this lab, we were asked to create a lab 13 folder complete with the
        usual index.html file, css & img folders, and organize our page
        accordingly. We were then asked to create a frame and style it. We were
        then asked to pick a website and replicate the typography on our own
        site and link it using a second created html file.</p>
    <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>I had a <b>TON</b> of issues with this lab. I literally felt like I was over here minding my own baby-coder business
        learning how to make paragraphs turn <i>darkred</i>, and all of a sudden I was
        hit with "Ok, now make a cool website like this". That being said, there were
        too many difficulties to list. I ran across a lot of things I just
        wasn't sure how to do and the things I tried didn't work. I really wanted
        to remove the space above "Sign up" and "Log in", but nothing I tried
        worked :(</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>I did the best I could to recreate this website. I used several different resources
        and after a shitload of trial and error, managed to produce a decent semblance of my
        sample website. I did as much as I could in four hours but there were a few things I couldn't figure out, despite my
      best efforts. </p>
