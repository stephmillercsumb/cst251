	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<p>My name is Stephanie and I am the mistress of everything. <br>
		I love photography, my family, my pet rats, surfing and the ocean. <br>
		I don't get much spare time, but when I do, I love spending it outside<br>
		in the sun with my partner and my kids. In the future, I hope to move<br>
		back to Hawaii and surf everyday.<br>
		My partner's name is Marisia. She likes to be called Mia and has 3 plants.<br>
