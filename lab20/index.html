    <h1>Lab 20: Team Project Sketches</h1>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>In this lab, we were asked to create sketches of our team project
          website, then upload them to our webpage. </p>
      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
        <p>I experienced no difficuties in this lab as I love to draw, sketch,
          and design. I am a visual design major, so this has been my favorite
          lab thus far. </p>
      <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>Pictured below are my sketches. My design aesthetic focuses more on
           imagery and less on text. I enjoy simplistic, bold designs that
           are not too wordy. I added a small bit of color as a possible
           color palette for the site as well. </p>
