    <h1>Lab 15: Fancy CSS</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>In this lab, we were asked to create the usual lab page and then style
        it using "fancy css"(which is a far cry from what we were asked to do
        last lab, thank fuck) </p>
    <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>I didn't encounter any difficulties in this lab because I followed
        lecture slides which were pretty self explanatory. </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Yet another slightly fancy-ass webpage, styled by yours truly. </p>
