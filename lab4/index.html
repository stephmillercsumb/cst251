	<h1>Lab 3: File Transfer</h1>
<body>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Create an index file for lab 4. Test files locally using your browser to
			make sure everything is working properly. Modify your files and publish
			them to the web. Test out your uploaded website. </p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I really didn't encounter too many problems with this lab. After
			installing Atom & Github, we were already taught how to push changes made
			locally to the web, so I have been doing that everytime I have made
			changes previously. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results of this lab are this index.html file created through Atom,
			then uploaded to my website via Github desktop. </p>
