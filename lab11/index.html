      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>In this lab, we were asked to create for Lab 11 an index.html file
          with a main section, a navigation bar, and a sidebar. We were also
          asked to create a CSS stylesheet and style the sidebar with
          inline-block styling, a minimum width of 300px, a width of 1/3 of the
          page, and positioned to the right.</p>
      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
        <p>I didn't really encounter any issues with this lab, despite not being
          present for class due to an emergency. I found it <i>relatively</i>
          simple to <i>fix</i> the position of the elements
         (see what I did there? haha).
      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results are these stylish block elements and hella pictures of
        my dog.</p>

        <h3>Barbosssa the Great</h3>
          <p>I just got a Great Dane puppy; his name is <b>Barbossa</b>,
            like Captain of the Black Pearl. I'm not really a dog person or I
            guess I should say I formerly wasn't a dog person, but
            the universe told me to get a dog, specifically a Great Dane, and
            now that I'm well into my 30s I've learned when the universe tells
            you to do something, probably best to just go with it.
