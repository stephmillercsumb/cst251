        <p>In this lab, we were asked to create an index.html file for Lab 9,
          a CSS file and style it appropriately with margins, padding, borders
          and an image.</p>
      <div id="subheader"><h2>Difficulties</h2></div>
        <p>I didn't experience any difficulties during this lab as I applied
          all of these skills in the last lab, but I was able to practice them
          with better understanding and try some new things. </p>
      <div id="subheader"><h2>Results</h2></div>
        <p>The results are yet another impeccably styled page by yours truly.
          You're still welcome.</p>
