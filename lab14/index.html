    <h1>Lab 14: Typography II</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>In this lab, we were asked to do the same thing we did in the previous
        lab, only choose a more difficult website to recreate. </p>
    <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>Because I experienced a lot of difficulties in the previous lab, I
        purposefully used the website from the lecture to recreate for this lab
        so that I would be able to follow along with the positioning. It turns
        out this was a sound decision because I was able to recreate this site
        pretty well with minimal difficulties. The caption box at the bottom
        moves even though I specified an absolute position so I will have to
        ask about that in class. </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The results are as you see in the frame; a pretty decent recreation of
        website using only type and images that I found. </p>
